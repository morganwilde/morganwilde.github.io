    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <p>
        First, let's lay out all of the tools that we have from the very beginning.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Points</li>
        <li>Grid</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A point knows only the state it's in.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>State - On/Off</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The grid is a point container. Besides holding a bunch of points, it also has to have information about it's size. Without a specified size, there would be ambiguity as to the exact position of each dot, because a collection of n dots has n possible width and height combinations. You can only access points through the grid.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A collection of points</li>
        <li>Horizontal size - width</li>
        <li>Vertical size - height</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>
        First, we need to define a method of how to access specific points. In a 2-dimensional world you can define all possible points using a set of two basis vectors (one horizontal, one vertical):
    </p>
    <ul class="code">
        <li>h = (1, 0)</li>
        <li>v = (0, 1)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To define a new position, we calculate the sum of the two basis vectors. The x and y factors indicate how far along the horizontal and vertical axis do we need to go to find the point.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        position = (x * h) + (y * v) = (x, y)
    </div>
    <p>
        To map between a given position (x, y) and the point number p, we need the following rule.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        map(x, y) = p = y * height + x
    </div>
    <p>
        That's all we need to start drawing.
    </p>
